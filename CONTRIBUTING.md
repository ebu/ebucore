SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Although possible, it is NOT encouraged to make edits via the github web client on line.
The web client will be used to manage commits, pull requests and comments.
Edit shall be made using the github desktop application after you have cloned the repository.

SCHEMA UPDATES

1. Install https://desktop.github.com/. Best practice consists of creating a github repository locally.
2. From the web client, clone the repository on your desktop.
3. Go to Github desktop application. The repository is now accessible from your desktop. Open it.
4. You should regularly sync with the online github to ensure that your contribution/commit is as close as possible to the current master.  
   Being too far "behind" may generate hard to resolve inconsistencies and conflicts.
5. Edit and VALIDATE your changes using an xml/xsd editor. You can work from the instance of the cloned 
   document or copy and paste a new version of the document under the local repository. 
   You can open the files with your editor directly from the file system. Changes will be managed automatically.
   Finish your edits and save the file.
6. Back in the Github desktop application, click on "changes" (middle top of the main page) and your modifications will appear.
   CREATE a new branch by clicking on the fork logo at the top 
   left corner of the main window. Avoid commiting to the Master branch.
   Name the branch (either a short name summarising the edits or e.g. identifying yourself).
   You should now be working under that branch.
6. You can now COMMIT your changes to that new branch. Give a short title and description to your commit.
   Click on "Commit to myBranch".
7. You can now PUBLISH or SYNC your commit (right top corner of the main page on Github desktop.
   Note: you can create and publish/sync more than one commit on the same branch by repeating the operations mentioned above.
8. You can now go back to the Github web client where your commits will appear on line.
9. You can now CREATE A PULL REQUEST. This will notify the community of your contribution and call for review.
   If the review is positive, or after comments ahve been addressed, the changes will be merged with the Master branch.

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

Please use the "track changes" mode when updating the documentation. This will help reviewer identify and review your edits.

Thank you for your suggestions!
